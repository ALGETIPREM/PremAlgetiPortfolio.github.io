										<h3><a>Fraud detection in Banking Transactions <br />
										</a></h3>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> This project focuses on enhancing fraud detection in banking transactions through advanced machine learning techniques and smart data technology. By analyzing a dataset from Kaggle containing both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, the project identifies patterns and features indicative of fraud. The primary goal is to develop a robust IT solution that significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of fraud detection systems, thus fortifying financial systems against threats. The project employs ensemble learning methods, including Gradient Boosting and Random Forest classifiers, which have demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. Through meticulous data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, the project contributes to more effective fraud management techniques and the overall stability of financial systems.
										<br/>
										<h4><a>Key Highlights: <br />
										</a></h4>
										● Analyzed Kaggle dataset with fraud and non-fraud transactions.<br>
										● Preprocessed data using techniques like label encoding and feature scaling.<br>
										● Implemented Gradient Boosting and Random Forest classifiers.<br>
										● Achieved high accuracy with 99.73% for Gradient Boosting.<br>
										● Evaluated models using metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>
										● Enhanced model sensitivity to detect complex fraud patterns.
